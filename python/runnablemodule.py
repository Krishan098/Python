    PYTHON PACKAGE:
            directory that contains zero or more python modules.
            can contain sub-packages.
            Each package contains a special file named __init__.py
'''
'''
    __init__.py: always executed when the package is imported.
    Use subpackages to group related modules together.
'''
'''
    For a runnable package ,__main__.py  is required in the root folder.

    A module is always a single file, while a package can contain many modules.
    A module bundles Python functions, classes, constants, and anything else you want to make reusable. A package, in turn, bundles modules.
    Modules can exist independently and donâ€™t need to be part of a package, while a package needs modules to be useful.
    Together, packages and modules form a powerful way of organizing our code.
